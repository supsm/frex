/**
 * Provides hooks to inject new models for loading and to intercept
 * model loading requests.
 *
 * <p>Injection of new models is accomplished via {@link #registerLocationProvider(ModelLocationProvider)}.
 *
 * <p>To intercept model <em>variants</em> - the different configurations of block models for each block
 * state property combination - use {@link #registerVariantProvider(Function)}.  This can also be used to
 * accept the {@code #inventory} variant used for item models.
 *
 * <p>To intercept model <em>files</em> use {@link #registerResourceProvider(Function)}. This is mainly useful
 * for loading models in other file formats, while retaining the vanilla mechanisms for randomized and multipart
 * models.
 *
 * <p>When intercepting model load requests, note that both provider types act as a predicate - they return {@code null}
 * to indicate the request was not intercepted.  If two provides try to handle the same path, then only one will
 * actually be used and the order is indeterminate.
 *
 * <p>While it is possible to provide a different provider for each individual path, the preferred approach is to
 * register a provider that intercepts many or all variations of a block or item (or even a group of them) and return
 * a single, shared dynamic model instance that alters output according to input context. This will generally
 * be more powerful (and is a main feature of the FREX model API) and will generally also be more memory efficient.
