/**
 * Use this to inject constant declarations that are managed by the mod into shaders .
 *
 * <p>The declarations are referenced by including a provided token in the shader(s) that need them.
 * They are provided by the mod as a string and consumed when needed by the renderer.
 *
 * <p>For example if you have a config option named {@code BOOP} with three choices: {@code BOOP_NEVER},
 * {@code BOOP_SOMETIMES} and {@code BOOP_ALWAYS} then you'd generate something like this:
 *
 * <p><pre>
 * #define BOOP_NEVER 0
 * #define BOOP_SOMETIMES 1
 * #define BOOP_ALWAYS 2
 *
 * // currently selected config
 * #define BOOP BOOP_ALWAYS
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Shader authors can reference this like so:
 *
 * <pre>
 * #include mymod:boop_config
 *
 * #if BOOP == BOOP_ALWAYS
 * // code that always boops goes here
 * #endif
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>This is only suitable for configuration that can be represented as boolean or numeric values
 * via preprocessor declarations and that remain static until changed by the player.
 *
 * <p>The renderer implementation is responsible for detecting multiple/nested {code #include}
 * statements for the same token and for ignoring all duplicate occurrences.
