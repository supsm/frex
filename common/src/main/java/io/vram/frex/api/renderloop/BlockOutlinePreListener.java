/**
 * Called before default block outline rendering and before checks are
 * done to determine if it should happen. Can optionally cancel the default
 * rendering but all event handlers will always be called.
 *
 * <p>Use this to decorate or replace the default block outline rendering
 * for specific modded blocks or when the need for a block outline render
 * would not be detected.  Normally, outline rendering will not happen for
 * entities, fluids, or other game objects that do not register a block-type hit.
 *
 * <p>Returning false from any event subscriber will cancel the default block
 * outline render and suppress the {@code BLOCK_RENDER} event.  This has no
 * effect on other subscribers to this event - all subscribers will always be called.
 * Canceling here is appropriate when there is still a valid block hit (with a fluid,
 * for example) and you don't want the block outline render to appear.
 *
 * <p>This event should NOT be used for general-purpose replacement of
 * the default block outline rendering because it will interfere with mod-specific
 * renders.  Mods that replace the default block outline for specific blocks
 * should instead subscribe to {@link BlockOutlineListener}.
