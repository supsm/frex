/**
 * Called after block outline render checks are made and before the
 * default block outline render runs.  Will NOT be called if the default outline
 * render was cancelled in {@link #BEFORE_BLOCK_OUTLINE}.
 *
 * <p>Use this to replace the default block outline rendering for specific blocks that
 * need special outline rendering or to add information that doesn't replace the block outline.
 * Subscribers cannot affect each other or detect if another subscriber is also
 * handling a specific block.  If two subscribers render for the same block, both
 * renders will appear.
 *
 * <p>Returning false from any event subscriber will cancel the default block
 * outline render.  This has no effect on other subscribers to this event -
 * all subscribers will always be called.  Canceling is appropriate when the
 * subscriber replacing the default block outline render for a specific block.
 *
 * <p>This event is not appropriate for mods that replace the default block
 * outline render for <em>all</em> blocks because all event subscribers will
 * always render - only the default outline render can be cancelled.  That should
 * be accomplished by mixin to the block outline render routine itself, typically
 * by targeting {@link LevelRenderer#renderShape}.
