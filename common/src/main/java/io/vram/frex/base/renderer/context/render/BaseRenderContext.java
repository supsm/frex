/**
 * Base class for all render contexts. ender contexts handle state management
 * and access required by models. Holds shared fields and utility methods
 * common to sub-types but the behavior and inputs for each type of
 * context vary too much to define abstract methods at this level.
 *
 * <p>The same type of model can have different contexts. A block rendering as
 * terrain vs a falling blocks rendering as an entity is one example.
 *
 * <p>The functionality of sub-types will fall into up to
 * five phases of activity:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><em>Batch Setup Phase: </em>
 *   Contexts with state shared across multiple game objects will need a method
 *   to initialize it.  The method will be called before a batch of one or more
 *   game objects (and their models) are rendered. {@link PastelTerrainRenderContext#prepareForRegion} is one example.
 *   Some contexts do not need this phase.
 *   </li>
 *   <li><em>Model Setup Phase: </em>
 *   Models assume some state is established before they output. Render contexts
 *   will have methods for callers to initialize model-specific state as game
 *   objects are iterated. The context will also use this for internal housekeeping
 *   like per-model cache invalidation.
 *   </li>
 *   <li><em>Model Output Phase: </em>
 *   Control of execution is inverted while models render. Most implement one or
 *   more methods to be called from injections in code that handles vanilla model
 *   rendering for a given model type and scenario.  The methods are highly specific
 *   to individual use cases so no attempt is made to define them in the base class.
 *
 *   <p>Once invoked, usually with a model or game object as inputs, the render
 *   context provides some flavor of InputContext plus a QaudSink, calls some
 *   variant of {@link DynamicModel#renderDynamic} and the model reacts by emitting
 *   zero or more polygons until it completes.
 *
 *   <p>During this phase the context satisfies many API requirements that aren't
 *   directly visible to or controlled by the model: material mapping,
 *   quad transformation, routing of vertices to the correct buffer, etc.
 *
 *   <p>This phase varies significantly by context but some elements can be
 *   reliably shared across sub-types and most of the members of this class
 *   relate to Model Output. (See individual method and field descriptions.)
 *   </li>
 *   <li><em>Model Cleanup Phase: </em>
 *   Some contexts have methods to release resources or manage shared state
 *   after model output is complete.
 *   </li>
 *   <li><em>Batch Cleanup Phase: </em>
 *   Some contexts have methods to release resources or manage shared state
 *   after a batch of models is complete.  The context will have no way to
 *   know that a batch is done, so these methods must always be called by the
 *   code that is iterating the batch.
 *   </li>
 * </ul>
